  abstract={We present DiffInfinite, a hierarchical diffusion model that generates arbitrarily large histological 
  images while preserving long-range correlation structural information. 
  Our approach first generates synthetic segmentation masks, subsequently used as conditions for the high-fidelity generative diffusion process. 
  The proposed sampling method can be scaled up to any desired image size while only requiring small patches for fast training. 
  Moreover, it can be parallelized more efficiently than previous large-content generation methods while avoiding tiling artefacts. 
  The training leverages classifier-free guidance to augment a small, sparsely annotated dataset with unlabelled data. 
  Our method alleviates unique challenges in histopathological imaging practice: large-scale information, costly manual annotation, and protective data handling. 
  The biological plausibility of DiffInfinite data is validated in a survey by ten experienced pathologists as well as a downstream segmentation task. 
  Furthermore, the model scores strongly on anti-copying metrics which is beneficial for the protection of patient data.},

  abstract={Light propagates from the object through the optics up to the sensor to create an
image. Once the raw data is collected, it is processed through a complex image
signal processing (ISP) pipeline to produce an image compatible with human
perception. However, this processing is rarely considered in machine learning
modelling because available benchmark data sets are generally not in raw format.
This study shows how to embed the forward acquisition process into the machine
learning model. We consider the optical system and the ISP separately. Following
the acquisition process, we start from a drone and airship image dataset to emulate
realistic satellite raw images with on-demand parameters. The end-to-end process
is built to resemble the optics and sensor of the satellite setup. These parameters
are satellite mirror size, focal length, pixel size and pattern, exposure time and
atmospheric haze. After raw data collection, the ISP plays a crucial role in neural
network robustness. We jointly optimize a parameterized differentiable image
processing pipeline with a neural network model. This can lead to speed up and
stabilization of classifier training at a margin of up to 20\% in validation accuracy.

  author={Falsi, Ludovica and Aversa, Marco and Di Mei, Fabrizio and Pierangeli, Davide and Xin, Feifei and Agranat, Aharon J and DelRe, Eugenio},
  abstract={We perform percolation analysis of crossed-polarizer transmission images in a biased nanodisordered bulk KTN: Li perovskite. 
  Two distinct percolative transitions are identified at two electric field thresholds. 
  The low-field transition involves a directional fractal chain of dimension D= 1.65, while the high-field transition has a dimension D> 2. 
  Direct cluster imaging in the volume is achieved using high-resolution orthographic 3D projections based on giant refraction. 
  Percolation is attributed to a full-3D domain reorientation that mediates the transition from a ferroelectric supercrystal state to a disordered domain mosaic.},
