  abstract={Accurately detecting and classifying damage in analogue media such as paintings, photographs, textiles, mosaics, 
  and frescoes is essential for cultural heritage preservation. While machine learning models excel in correcting global degradation 
  if the damage operator is known a priori, we show that they fail to predict where the damage is even after supervised training; 
  thus, reliable damage detection remains a challenge. We introduce DamBench, a dataset for damage detection in diverse analogue media, 
  with over 11,000 annotations covering 15 damage types across various subjects and media. We evaluate CNN, Transformer, and 
  text-guided diffusion segmentation models, revealing their limitations in generalising across media types.},

  abstract={Light propagates from the object through the optics up to the sensor to create an
  image. Once the raw data is collected, it is processed through a complex image
  signal processing (ISP) pipeline to produce an image compatible with human
  perception. However, this processing is rarely considered in machine learning
  modelling because available benchmark data sets are generally not in raw format.
  This study shows how to embed the forward acquisition process into the machine
  learning model. We consider the optical system and the ISP separately. Following
  the acquisition process, we start from a drone and airship image dataset to emulate
  realistic satellite raw images with on-demand parameters. The end-to-end process
  is built to resemble the optics and sensor of the satellite setup. These parameters
  are satellite mirror size, focal length, pixel size and pattern, exposure time and
  atmospheric haze. After raw data collection, the ISP plays a crucial role in neural
  network robustness. We jointly optimize a parameterized differentiable image
  processing pipeline with a neural network model. This can lead to speed up and
  stabilization of classifier training at a margin of up to 20\% in validation accuracy.},
